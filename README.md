- the rotation of the camera is yet to be fixed
- the raycasting is functional but had to be tweaked a bit and turned into a toggle.

- for the improved homework while moving you can't interact with buildings to make sure things move smoothly.

# Week Three
- the controls are the same
- the rotation of the camera is yet to be fixed
- the raycasting remains the same
- attempted to add a canvas to view a video (it will be heroes of the storm gameplay for now) for added interaction in the map but it is not functional. Will update in the future
- Here is the Link to Homework #3 [CLICK HERE](https://Gman9000.github.io/GranvilleCreativeWeb.github.io/gj506HW3.html) to view

# Week Four
- VR experience on Mobile
- same map but your gaze interacts with the buildings instead of you moving around
- i tried to implement motion to movement but that proved to be challenging. i'll probably do that in the next iteration of this project
- ambient music is in now! the phone forced me to do user interaction to start it so i decided to make it happen on a touch input which the user has to do in order to start the VR experience anyway
- Here is the link to Homework #4 [CLICK HERE](https://Gman9000.github.io/The-Creative-Web-Granville's-HW/classes/class4/examples/index.html) to view
